Various random ideas that aren't (yet) part of the design

- Character is 1.5 blocks tall
- Can crawl to fit inside 1 block tall gaps


- Multiple tile layers.
    - Back layer
    - Wall layer
    - Ore/misc insert layer

- No world hopping.
  Characters are worlds are linked together, like in Minecraft.

- No respawn after quit&save. Player character continues where it left off.
